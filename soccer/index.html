  <h2>Soccer</h2>

      <p>
        I have been playing soccer all my life and am obsessed with the sport. I
        was introduced at a young age from my father who was an avid soccer fan
        in Poland. He had me lacing up my boots since I could walk and I never
        looked back. It was a dream of mine to play college soccer and I am so
        happy I was able to make that happen at IIT as well as being the top
        goal scorer of the season as a Freshman.

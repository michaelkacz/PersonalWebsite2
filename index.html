    <h2>About Me:</h2>

      <p>
        I am a second year Information Technology student at the Illinois
        Institute of Technology. I'm a Chicago native and have lived here all my
        life with a love for computers and tech, so IIT was the place for me.
        Along with being a full time student, I also am
        a striker on the Illinois Tech Men's Soccer team. I am passionate about
        Rap music as well as discovering different and new artists to listen to.
        Aditionally, I am a big fan of the soccer club Manchester City as
        well as the Polish National Team.
